I am a Technical Staff member at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory (MITLL)](https://www.ll.mit.edu/) in Group 102, Embedded & AI Systems. Before this, I was a PhD student at UC Berkeley in the [Neaton Group](https://sites.google.com/lbl.gov/neaton-group) in the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering. 

My research focus is on practical applications of computational chemistry and machine learning to accelerate the materials discovery process. This has me tackling problems in many different areas, from conformer searches and reaction prediction in chemistry to active learning and generative models in machine learning. I also have experience working with protein language models, training them from scratch, fine-tuning, and using them in downstream predictions.
