Education
======
* Ph.D in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, UC Berkeley, 2023
* B.S. in Chemical and Biological Engineering, Northwestern University, 2018

Work experience
======
* (Sept. 2023 - present) **MIT Lincoln Laboratory**: Technical Staff
  * Leading the search for rare-earth-free permanent magnets via high throughput density functional theory (DFT) calculations, spin-informed machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs), and Monte Carlo simulations for finite-temperature magnetic properties
  * Accelerated DFT calculations by 26% using predicted charge density grids from a rotation-equivariant machine learning model
  * Led the implementation of generative models, active learning, and reaction prediction strategies to discover novel molecular colorimetric sensors, reducing experiment time
  * Developed proof-of-concept model for public health monitoring via antibody binder identification using AbLang, ESM-2
  * Led informal presentations and discussions on how machine learning and computational chemistry can accelerate materials discovery for defense applications
  * Presented work at APS, ACS, RAAINS


* (Summer 2019) **Kebotix**: Machine Learning Intern
  * Created graph convolutional neural networks for predicting optoelectronic properties of small molecules. Discovered novel candidates not studied in the academic or patent literature. 
  * Created web interface for receiving chemist feedback in a self-driving laboratory prototype
  
Academic experience
======
* (2018 - 2023) **UC Berkeley, Neaton Group**: PhD candidate
  * Developed novel artificial intelligence methodology for efficient materials discovery
  * Consistently found top methane storage materials by evaluating only ~0.1% of the database using Bayesian optimization
  * Discovered new air separation materials with a novel acquisition function to target O2 adsorption enthalpy
  * Determined trends in air separation materials using quantum chemistry calculations and benchmarked density functional approximations
  * Theorized and experimentally verified new, high adsorption energy carbon capture material using machine-learned interatomic potentials and simulated annealing in LAMMPS
  * Presented findings at multiple conferences such as APS, ACS, AIChE

Awards
======
* (2023) Kavli ENSI Philomathia Graduate Fellowship
* (2019) NSF Graduate Student Research Fellowship Honorable Mention
* (2019, 2021) 2x Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award
